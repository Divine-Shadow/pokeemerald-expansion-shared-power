# Data Guidelines

- Edit source JSON and script files; generated binary outputs are built, not manually edited.
- For maps, use Porymap or an equivalent editor and run the appropriate `make` targets to regenerate the outputs.
- When adding new data folders, keep names consistent and in alphabetical order.
