# Documentation Guidelines

- For authoring and previewing docs locally, follow `docs/local_mdbook/ubuntu_WSL.md`.
- Update navigation entries in `docs/SUMMARY.md` whenever adding or moving docs pages.
- Design docs should follow the structure and linking guidance in `docs/design/AGENTS.md`.
- To include root-level Markdown in the docs site, use mdBook includes as shown in `docs/local_mdbook/ubuntu_WSL.md`.
